Organizational resources include intellectual capital, products, and financial capital, but the most important resource is human capital—the people who make it all happen. — location: [161]() ^ref-4357

---
after the vision is set forth, nothing will happen without an implementation strategy. This is where responsibilities are determined and accountabilities defined. A timeline should be created, and milestone reviews should be scheduled, so that the strategic plan is constantly in front of the leadership and discussed at staff meetings. — location: [207]() ^ref-30360

---
Once the strategic areas that will affect employees are identified, the planners need to determine whether the organization lacks any resources that will cause problems in the implementation phase. It is at this point in the process that HR issues—a critical element in the strategic plan—really come into play. Organizations that involve HR in the strategic planning process soon learn that issues about people have an effect on nearly every organizational activity. — location: [218]() ^ref-4189

HR is increasingly complex, it is not a stand-alone function. For HR professionals to be true business partners, they must learn as much as possible about the operation of their organization's business. Studying business plans, strategic plans, annual reports, and other written documents is one of the best ways to do this; so is networking with others in the organization. — location: [256]() ^ref-23834

The most common mistake organizations make with recruiting is to hire on an ad hoc or, worse yet, emergency basis. You've signed a new client, and you need to staff up quickly. A trusted employee decides to leave, and you need to find someone immediately to do their work. Your organization is growing fast, and your current staff can't keep up with the workload. Of course, these situations can and do occur from time to time, and they're often unavoidable. — location: [298]() ^ref-21199

A much better way to go about talent acquisition is to tie in your hiring with the strategic HR goals — location: [304]() ^ref-16458

When you advertise or post a position, it is important to stress the benefits of working for your organization. Applicants want to know what's in it for them. Another critical element is setting your organization apart from all the others that are hiring for the same type of position: What can you tell job seekers that will excite them enough to contact your organization? Include the job requirements and what's expected of the chosen applicant to make it as easy as possible for applicants to submit their information online. Direct applicants to your website to learn more about the organization. Don't forget about your organization's culture when it comes to posting job ads. One of the most common reasons for buyer's remorse when a new employee doesn't work out is simply because they weren't a “good fit. — location: [313]() ^ref-42340

---
To save everyone's time, let the job seeker know the range at the beginning of the call and ask whether the interview should continue. It is among the first thing applicants want to know, yet they're very reluctant to specify their most recent salary or their desired range, for fear they'll limit themselves or be dismissed as over- or underqualified. — location: [371]() ^ref-7499

Questions alone—even great ones—do not make an interview successful! So what does? The interviewer's capacity for listening effectively, avoiding quick judgments, accepting silences, and remaining objective. — location: [444]() ^ref-50496

Thank the applicant for his or her time—and remember, every applicant is a potential customer. — location: [461]() ^ref-26761

The ultimate goal of onboarding is to turn a new “hire” into a productive “employee” as quickly and efficiently as possible. While some organizations are satisfied with a half-day orientation that consists of little more than reading the employee handbook and filling out W-2 forms, others have a formal agenda for onboarding that can last up to a year and include a variety of activities, meetings, and events. The results of such well-planned programs speak for themselves. According to the Boston Consulting Group, organizations with strong onboarding programs see 2.5 times the profit growth and 1.9 times the profit margin of those who don't — location: [510]() ^ref-20113

Statistics show that half of all hourly employees leave their jobs within four months of their first day at work, and half of all salaried employees leave within eighteen months.2 When you think of all the time and money you invested in recruiting these employees—not to mention training them—you can see why this kind of turnover would be enormously expensive for your organization. — location: [516]() ^ref-30881

Many terminations that are written off as “bad hires” are actually the result of bad onboarding. — location: [534]() ^ref-12768

To succeed in their jobs, new employees need to be drawn into the team and the organizational family. When new hires don't succeed, it's often because they're not a “good fit” within the culture of the workplace. Research by Recruitment Solutions shows that 47 percent of employee turnover occurs in the first ninety days — location: [585]() ^ref-16965

You can't manage what you don't measure. Some key aspects to quantify are turnover, how long it takes for new hires to become productive, and employee satisfaction. Keeping track of measures such as this will provide support for developing and improving strategic onboarding programs. — location: [636]() ^ref-48129

Ongoing development has been recognized as an important aspect of employee retention, and it should not be underestimated. To quote a Chinese proverb: If you want one year of prosperity, grow grain. If you want ten years of prosperity, grow trees. If you want one hundred years of prosperity, grow people. — location: [725]() ^ref-6354

Individual Personal Development Plan (IPDP). (This is not to be confused with the Performance Improvement Plan, which is for employees who are struggling with their jobs and need to show improvement before facing discipline or termination.) The IPDP is a tool for talented employees that seeks to use the entire spectrum of training modalities in a systematic way to help employees reach their full potential. The IPDP is usually a written plan for developing specific knowledge, skills, and competencies that will be valuable for both the short-term goals of the organization and the employee's long-term career goals. The IPDP's purpose is to improve the employee's performance in current work assignments while preparing him or her for greater responsibilities in the future.7 The plan can include every kind of training method, including mentoring, coaching, public seminars, adult-education classes, high-tech training tools, and whatever else is deemed helpful for the employee's development. — location: [768]() ^ref-48512

After a training session or program has been completed, senior management will have one important question for you: “Did it work?” “It's too soon to tell,” is not a satisfactory answer, even if it may be true. That's why you need techniques for measuring and evaluating the effectiveness of employee training—not only to keep your bosses satisfied, but also to know how much more training, and what kinds of additional training, may be needed. Assessing training effectiveness often entails using the four-level model developed by Donald Kirkpatrick.11 According — location: [814]() ^ref-3566

The need for recognition is a basic human desire. Failing to provide performance feedback to your employees is a major reason why employees quit or become disengaged. Employees need feedback to grow, improve, and perform at higher level. Managers need a way to communicate their expectations and goals. Performance appraisals help managers groom employees for succession planning and career advancement. Most importantly, they help every employee pull in the same direction to achieve organizational goals and objectives. — location: [973]() ^ref-3163

First, make your reviews less formal and do them more than once a year. Consider using a system of informal check-ins or discussions that occur on a quarterly, monthly, or even weekly basis — location: [979]() ^ref-61312

---
Second, remove as much paperwork and red tape from the system as possible. Elements such as numerical scales and check-off boxes have outlived their usefulness. Some organizations have streamlined their system down to just a handful of simple questions to ask after the completion of every major project — location: [984]() ^ref-65118

---
Third, focus on employee development. Make sure the performance review meeting is a two-way street in which the employee has ample time to address ideas and concerns. Help the employee understand that he or she must take responsibility for his or her own career advancement, but the manager is always there to help with advice and direction. When you talk to an employee about mistakes, remember that these are not occasions for discipline but opportunities for “coachable moments.” We always learn more from our mistakes than from our successes — location: [989]() ^ref-21627
